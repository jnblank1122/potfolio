# Portfolio Website

#### This is our first solo project at epicodus, where we have been instructed to create a portfolio website, Friday, August 5th, 2016.

#### By Jake Blank

## Description

_This website was made with html, css, and bootstrap.  The pages consist of a home page, an about page, a background page, a portfolio page, a my interests page, as well as a contact page.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* First you must click the Github repository link to get to my repository.
* Next you will see a folder labeled Portfolio, click it!
* Then you will see my index.html page, my css folder, my pages folder, and my img/doc folders.
* Finally to view the website, just click to download the entire portfolio, where you will then be able to double-click the index.html page where my website should pop up in your browser.

## Known Bugs

-The sub navigation under portfolio is just to show that I know how to use a drop down menu, it won't lead you to any pages.
